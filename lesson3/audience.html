            <h1>Target Audience</h1>
            <p>The target audience for this site is local businesses who want to join the chamber, and current 
                members to obtain information such as community and chamber events, training, and policies.The site 
                aims to meet the needs of companies and potential entrepreneurs who want to start or improve their 
                own economic activity in the region. Create a way to build better business networks both locally 
                and internationally. Provide information to those who are interested in finding the attractions 
                and events of the city. It also supports government and non-profit organizations seeking additional 
                resources or information from the State.</p>
            <p>My first person is a new entrepreneur about 42 years old named Martín Quiroz. He is married and 
                has 3 children. He has worked all his life for textile companies and with his experience, he has 
                decided to start his own textile business. Martin wants to join the Chamber of Commerce to get 
                involved in the community and have access to the group's benefits and expertise. He mainly uses his 
                smartphone to access the website. He has no one to help him with digital marketing, he goes to 
                the web to look for candidates or businesses that provide him with digital marketing services. </p>
            <p>The second person is Guadalupe Ore, a 45 years old administrative manager of a large Saga Falabella 
                corporation who wants to find training on topics important to the company, such as 
                diversity/inclusion. In addition, he is looking for help to expand his networking presence 
                to promote his business. She is married and has 1 daughter who is a teenager. She can access 
                the website via phone as well as from her laptop.</p>
