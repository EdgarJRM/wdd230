            <h1>Target Audience</h1>
            <p>The target audience for this site is local businesses who want to join the chamber, and current members to obtain information such as community and chamber events, training, and policies.</p>
            <p>My first persona is a new, small business owner in her mid-30s named Loretta. She is of Hispanic origin with a bachelor's degree in business. Loretta's parents were farmers, and she is the first to graduate from college in her family. She is married, but has no kids. Loretta wants to join the Chamber to get involved in the community, and get access to the benefits and experience of the group. She mainly uses her smartphone to access the website, </p>
            <p>The second persona is Todd, a 50 year old marketing manager of a large corporation who is looking for training on topics important to their company such as diversity/inclusion. He also wants to participate in community events that allow him to advertise the business. Todd doesn't have a degree, but has 30 years of experience in marketing. He is married with 3 kids who are young adults or teenagers.</p>
